                            <p>This article was a great introduction for cool user interfaces. Each UI had an interesting, distinct
                                element that contributed to the style of the website. Overall, this article provided great 
                                inspiration for website UI design choices.

                            <p>I didn't really have a favorite part of the article, though I thought some of the inspirations 
                                were really cool, which I explain next. They all feature an innovative concept that perform the same 
                                action, but in a more visually pleasing way. I found most of the transition concepts to
                                be especially fascinating.

                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p>My favorite inspiration was the Norde Add to Cart Interaction. This kept the image of the shoe
                                constant while changing the background and provided a sleek way to choose shoe size. This provides
                                an easier way for the customers to shop and also an interesting design which captures the user's
                                attention. Overall, this interactoin was a really fascinating way of transitioning from the
                                description screen to the selection screen.

                            <p>3. Though I liked looking at the UIs, I wish there was an explanation teaching us how 
                                to make such cool UIs ourselves.
