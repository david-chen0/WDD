					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this video? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>This video was helpful in shifting my views towards the social impacts of web design. Though it 
								may seem to have no impact at first glance, some small design decisions, such as pronoun inclusion,
								can create a feeling of inclusion or exclusion. Overall, one should be wary of these social impacts
								when making design choices.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this video? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>I liked the part about gonzo design. The concept was intriguing to me, as it can be used to 
								display the designer's choices and narrative. However, it must be used carefully, as it can also
								neglect important aspects of the users, such as religion, race, gender, and more.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool.</p>
							<p>Within a design system's greatest power is also its greatest weakness.</p>
						</li>
					</ul>

						<li>
							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy this video and why?</p>
							<p>3. It wasn't anything too interesting, but it did introduce me to some topics related to 
								web design.
