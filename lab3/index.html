        	<p><b>Prompt:</b> A newspaper has approached you for choosing fonts for both their physical print as well as their digital website. Since the newspaper has been around for a long time, it would like its physical print copies to reflect its history and heritage. However, for their website, they want a more modernized, sleek look that's easier to read. Browse Google fonts, Adobe fonts, or any of the websites from the design lecture, and select fonts for both the physical print copies of the newspaper as well as the digital website for the headline, titles, and body. Mock up both formats, and explain why you chose the fonts/size/weights you chose.</p>
