				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p>I knew most of the things from this article beforehand, but just didn't know the technical names
							for the dark mode designs. I've gone through (annoying) dark mode designs before, such as the forced
							continuity and hard-to-cancel gym memberships. There were, however, some that I didn't know about,
							such as roach motel and private zuckering.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p>I liked the examples the article gave for each dark mode design. This helped to illustrate to me 
							what exactly these dark mode designs were. For example, I didn't quite understand misdirection from
							the explanation, but the examples helped to clarify what it meant.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p>“ Find a way to help the vulnerable around you. If you have privilege, use it for good.”</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<div class="body-header">Feedback</div>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a
							five, please briefly explain why.</p>
						<p>2. It wasn't very interesting and I knew most the stuff on this article beforehand.</p>
