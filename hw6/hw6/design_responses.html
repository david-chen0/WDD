					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>I learned from this article about all the different aspects associated with animation. This 
								includes animation speed, style, motion type, easing, and more. I never really noticed beforehand
								how small changes, like an animation's speed curve, can affect the user's experience, but 
								the examples really helepd to demonstrate how all these attributes contribute to the animation.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>My favorite part of the article was the ease-in-out and other curves. The article does a really 
								good job of describing what each curve is supposed to do, then provides a concrete example for 
								me to understand what's going on. It also helps to see the different applications so I know 
								when I could use these animations.

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p>"But do not forget that animation is more of an art than science, so itâ€™s better to experiment and test your decisions on users."</p>
						</li>
