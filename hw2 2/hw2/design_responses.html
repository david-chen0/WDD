							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>This article helped me understand the effect of using whitespace, as I had beforehand 
								thought of it only as a way to increase readability. With its clear examples, the article
								demonstrated how whitespace is used to  maintain focus and improve visual organization.
								The final part also helped quell many of my concerns for using whitespace, such as it takes 
								away space for actual content or users may not be as willing to scroll.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>I liked the part where they dissected the way that they use whitespace in their web design.
								They first posited that the amount of pixels used for whitespace should always be in multiples
								of eight, then their demonstration of that through their products helped me to see why this 
								was helpful. Additionally, though this wasn't their intention, the grey bars between the words
								which blocked the whitespace made the text extremely unreadable, which further demonstrated
								the importance of whitespace to me.

							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>

								visual noise on this page and potentially increases conversion."</p>
