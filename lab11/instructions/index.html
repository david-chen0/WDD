<p>Today, we'll be applying what we've learned about loops and conditionals to better understand JavaScript's potential. JavaScript is hands down the most powerful tool you will learn in your web design career. HTML and CSS are both static: once we declare a style or a div, it doesn't change for the life span of the website. JS, on the other hand, not only allows us to change our website dynamically, but it allows us to change our HTML and CSS dynamically as well. This lab is meant to show you some of the applications of JS in different aspects of web design.</p>
<p>You must NOT make any changes to HTML/CSS document in these questions. All of your changes should only be in <code>script.js</code>.</p>

<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>By the end of this assignment, we will create a really cool food image filtering system using what we've learned about JavaScript. It should look like this.</p>
<video width="660" controls muted>
<source src="assets/final.mov" type="video/mp4" />

<h1 id="part-1-for-loops">Part 1: getElementsByClassName</h1>
<p>If you open up the <code>index.html</code>, it should have all the food items in a grid format and the nav bar at the top. All the buttons are in their active state (the items should be showing). Remember that <code>.getElementsByClassName("wdd")</code> returns a list of all the elements in the HTML with a class name "wdd". </p>
<p>Add code in your <code>script.js</code> file.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, get all of the nav bar items using <code>.getElementsByClassName</code> and assign it to the <code>navList</code> variable. We use this to assign an <code>.onclick</code> function to every one of the buttons in a loop (already done for you). Please try to understand why we do this. </li>
<li>Next inside of the function <code>filterImages()</code>, make a boolean (true/false) variable that checks to see if <code>button</code> contains "active" class and assign it to <code>buttonActive</code>. You will need to use this later when doing conditionals.
<br/ ><em>HINT: Our <code>filterImages()</code> function takes a parameter called <code>button</code>, which is an object that we can call whenever inside the function. How can we utilize this?</em></li>
<li>Lastly, we've given you a variable called <code>buttonName</code> that corresponds to the class name of the respective food item. Use this variable to get a list of all images of that specific food item and assign it to <code>itemList</code> (use .getElementsByClassName). This will be needed later to show/hide the respective images when the buttons are active/inactive.</li>
</ul>
<p>Great! At this point, nothing on your page should change yet.</p>
<h1 id="part-2-conditional-statements">Part 2: Conditional Statements and Loops</h1>
<p>Recall that an if statement, or conditional statement, is written like so:</p>
<pre><code class="js language-js"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (condition) {
    // <span class="hljs-keyword">Do</span> something that <span class="hljs-keyword">only</span> happens <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> the condition <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">true</span>
}</code></pre>
<p>where <code>condition</code> is a conditional expression (i.e. it returns <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>) that determines whether or not the body of the if statement gets executed.</p>
<!--<p>We can also use boolean operations to combine conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>x &amp;&amp; y</code> returns <code>true</code> if both <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> is true. If <code>x</code> is false, <code>y</code> will not be evaluated--it will immediately return false.</li>
<li><code>x || y</code> returns <code>true</code> if <code>x</code> or <code>y</code> is true (or both are true). If <code>x</code> is true, <code>y</code> will not be evaluated--it will immediately return true.</li>
</ul>-->
<p>Conditional statements allow us to define multiple states of our webpage. Now, the state of our webpage becomes conditionally dynamic--meaning that the state that one user sees can be completely different from another user based on the decisions of that user.</p>
<p>Also recall that you can create all of these elements using a for loop; recall that for loops are written like so:</p>
<pre><code class="js language-js"><span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">variable</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">start</span>; stoppingCondition; doAfterEachLoop) {
    // Things <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> do <span class="hljs-keyword">at</span> each iteration
}</code></pre>
<p>where <code>variable</code> is the name of the variable that serves as your iterator (often called <code>i</code> or <code>j</code> by convention--<code>i</code> is short for iterator!), <code>start</code> is the value at which <code>variable</code> should start in the first iteration of the loop, <code>stoppingCondition</code> is a conditional statement that determines when the loop should stop, and <code>doAfterEachLoop</code> is some statement that should be executed at the end of each loop to change the value of <code>variable</code> (e.g. for <code>i</code> to count up, <code>i++</code>, or to count down, <code>i--</code>).</p>
<p>Sometimes we want to be able to select multiple buttons at a time. For this part, when you toggle a button, all the associated pictures should appear/dissapear. Please do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>First in the same <code>filterImages()</code> function, let's define our <code>if</code> conditional.<br />
<em>HINT: What are the only two states a button can be in? The variable <code>buttonActive</code> looks pretty helpfulâ€¦ how can we use this this so that the correct block of code in the if statements gets run?</em></li>
<li>Next, inside the if block code and the else block code, add the class <code>"active"</code> and remove the class <code>"inactive"</code> from the clicked-on button if the button currently contains the <code>"inactive"</code> class (<code>buttonActive</code> is false). Vice versa for the other condition.<br />
<em>HINT: Our <code>filterImages()</code> function takes a parameter called <code>button</code>. How should we use this to add/remove classes from our buttons?</em></li>
<li>Now we will use loops to show/hide the respective food images based on the button clicked. Logically if the button we click on has the class <code>"active"</code>, we have to hide all the corresponding images and vice versa. So in the respective if/else block, we can change each images' CSS by making the <code>display</code> either <code>block</code> or <code>none</code>.
<br /><em>HINT: We made an <code>itemList</code> variable, which is a list containing all of the corresponding food images. We can use list indexing to get each image (i.e. <code>itemList[0]</code>, etc.)</em>
<br /><em>HINT: You can change a CSS property in JS by using <code>element.style.property = "whatever"</code>.</em></li>
<li>Lastly at the very end of <code>script.js</code>, assign the function you just completed to the event handler <code>.onclick</code> for the buttons. We want to use an anonymous function this time because <code>filterImages()</code> take in a parameter which correponds to a button in our <code>navList</code> list. What should we pass into the function as our paramter?
<br /><em>HINT: Since <code>navList</code> is a list, maybe we can use list indexing again?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Your filtering website should now be done!</p>
<p>If you are lost during this assignment, do not fret! Learning to program takes time and practice--we've just begun to explore, so don't worry if some of these concepts aren't quite clear. Be sure to ask a TA or instructor or post on Piazza to get your questions answered!</p>
<!--<h1 id="part-3-uploading-your-website-to-github">Part 3: Uploading Your Website to GitHub</h1>
<p>GitHub is a web service we can use to host our HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code, and have it be shared as a website, so other people can visit it on the web! We'll use GitHub to upload and share your final projects, and to help you prepare, we'll also go over how to deploy a site to the web using GitHub today in lab. This is also good practice for the final project!</p>
<p>We'll go over this portion together during the last part of the lab, but if you're coming back to this at a later date or want another reference, you can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlwxtfKO3a0">this video</a>, which also goes over how to use GitHub to deploy your website publicly.</p>
<p>Be sure to make an account at <a href="https://github.com">GitHub.com</a> if you don't have one yet -- it doesn't matter if you use your Berkeley email, or a personal one.</p>
<hr />
<p>Congratulations on hosting your first website! Ask a TA for checkoff whenever you're ready.</p>-->
