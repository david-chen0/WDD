        <p>The midterm project is a chance for you to give an ugly but popular website a fresh coat of paint using HTML
          &amp; CSS!</p>

      <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
      <p>Your task is to redesign and code the website for <a href="http://www.kingpindonuts.com/"
          target="_blank"><strong>King Pin Donuts</strong></a>, either on your own or with a partner. If you are working
        alone, it should have at least <strong>two distinct "views" -- we require Home and Menu pages. If you are
          working with a partner, we require a third distinct "view" --
          either Our Story or Find Us.</strong> Everything else is up to you! </p>
      <p>This means that you have the creative freedom to add or remove content, change up the layouts to your liking,
        and customize the visual design. Read this whole page for complete details on grading, deadlines, and
        deliverables. </p>
      <p>Reminder: While coding up your website, it is essential to link multiple pages properly so the audience can
        easily navigate the website by following links on your webpages. If you're unsure how to, ask us!</p>
      <h2 id="why-king-pin-donuts">Why King Pin Donuts?</h2>
      <img src="screenshots/kingpin.png" />
      <p>King Pin Donuts suffers from a design problem, some of which we have explored in class -- lack of visual
        hierarchy, poor typography, improper spacing, color usage, etc. If this website is meant to attract a customer,
        it’s not doing a very good job of it, even if the donuts themselves are delicious. We want to be able to
        redesign this website such that its appearance is able to attract new and consistent customers onsite. </p>
      <h2 id="important-dates">Important Dates</h2>
      <p>These are deadlines you should look out for: </p>

      <!-- <h2 id="team-sign-up-due-thur-103">Team Sign-up (due Thur 2/27)</h2>
  <p>If you can’t find a team partner, sign up here at <a href="https://wdd.io/go/group-team-finder" target="_blank">wdd.io/go/group-team-finder</a> and we’ll match someone for you!</p>

      <h2 id="project-check-in-4-points">Project Check-in (4 points)</h2>
      <p>You are required to check-in with your progress with WDD staff at their office hours <strong>before class on
          Thursday, October 19th</strong>. We have office hours every week, so please try to complete this early so you
        won't be waiting in line for other students on the last day.
        <br><br>
        To get full credit for this part, you must come with:
        completed mockups <strong>(home + menu pages, one additional page if working with a partner)</strong> of your
        site created in Figma (or whatever tool you're used to) in <strong>high-fidelity</strong>. We will review your
        design decisions and offer design/programming suggestions.
      </p>
      <h3 id="visual-design-10-points">Visual Design (10 points)</h3>
      <p>Here are some things to consider as you design your site.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Color scheme:</strong> Are colors too bright or too dark? Is there enough contrast between the text
          color and background color?</li>
        <li><strong>Typography:</strong> Is the font readable? Are different pieces of text appropriately sized?</li>
        <li><strong>Visual hierarchy/Layout:</strong> Is content organized logically? Is there sufficient spacing?</li>
        <li><strong>Overall:</strong> Do your visual elements convey the mood you want to create on the site? Do your
          design choices outline visual hierarchy? Show your friends/roommates/classmates - what do they think?</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="user-experience-10-points">User Experience (10 points)</h3>
      <p>For UX, think broad, about purpose. Here are some user experience considerations to think about</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Does the user have a <strong>consistent experience</strong> across the whole site?</li>
        <li>Is navigation <strong>clear and accessible</strong>?</li>
        <li>Is content (menus, location, contact info, etc) <strong>easy to find</strong>?</li>
        <li>Does this website <strong>make me want to go eat here?</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <div class="block block-highlight">
        <p><strong>Note on Functionality: </strong>We understand that we haven’t covered things like how to add a Google
          Maps widget, functioning buttons, or animations to your site. For more advanced functionality like that, we
          don’t expect a full implementation. For example, an image of a map would be sufficient.</p>
      </div>
      <h3 id="write-up-4-points">Write-up (4 points)</h3>
      <p>You are also responsible for a write-up explaining the design decisions you made throughout this project. Your
        design decisions should revolve around the key concepts discussed in class, including spacing, typography, and
        color. Aim for this document to be around 200-250 words. Be concise about your design choices! </p>
      <p>Attach your completed write-up in your Google Form submission.</p>
      <div class="block block-highlight">
        <p><strong>Note on Images: </strong> You can feel free to use any images you think would be appropriate for a
          donut shop website. However, if you use images that you found on the internet, you must cite your sources (a
          link to the website you found it from is fine) at the end of your write-up.</p>
        <p>A great site we recommend for finding stock photos is <a href="https://unsplash.com">unsplash.com.</a></p>
      </div>
      <h2 id="recommended-workflow">Recommended Workflow</h2>
      <p>The general steps that we recommend to complete this project are as follows:</p>
      <ol>
        <!-- <li>Form a group of two or three.</li> -->
        <li>Look at the King Pin Donuts website. What do they do well and what can be improved? Decide on the content of
          each page.</li>
        <li>Create the general page structure with a wireframe. Draw by hand! Re-iterate and decide what works before
          moving on.</li>
        <li>Mock up both pages, including content and images in Figma. Play with the color scheme and fonts and decide
          on a consistent theme. As you do this, think about the design decisions you’re making, which you’ll need to
          talk about in the write-up.</li>
        <li>Attend any TA or instructor’s office hours for your project check-in.</li>
        <li>Finalize the design, incorporating the TA’s feedback. This is also a good time to start the write-up.</li>
        <li>Create the HTML skeletons and CSS that would be used across every page - for example, the navigation links
          would have consistent CSS on every page of the site.</li>
        <li>Now that you have a “base,” you can more easily finish up the remaining pages.</li>
        <li>Check that the whole site has a cohesive look and feel.</li>
        <li>Complete the write-up and submit!</li>
      </ol>
      <h2 id="submission">Submission</h2>
      <p>The following is due by <strong>Tuesday, October 19th at 11:59 PM PST.</strong></p>
      <p>Create a zip file that contains the following files:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>index.html</code></li>
        <li>any additional <code>.html</code> files named whatever is appropriate for your pages</li>
        <li><code>assets/styles/style.css</code></li>
        <li><code>assets/images/</code></li>
      </ul>
