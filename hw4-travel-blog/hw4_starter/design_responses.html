						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>Through this article, I learned about the importance of accessibility and how to make a 
								website more accessible. Aside from the legal implications, accessibility is vital in drawing in
								users and helping them use the website. Color accessibility, which is a huge contributor towards
								general accessibility, is achieved through decent contrasts, accounting for those with disabilities, 
								supporting features, and more.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>I liked the section on not relying solely on color. They provide examples of what color can 
								and can't do. For example, color can be a good way to display graphs or data, but it is not 
								an efficient way to convey an error message or to appeal to the visually impaired.
