							<p>What are your thoughts on this article and its topic? Did it influence your opinion in any way? What were some interesting examples (good or bad)? (4-5 sentences)</p>
							<p>I liked the article's description of the psychological factors that go into design. I definitely
								agree with the arguments presented, as the examples they gave made sense. For instance, the example
								presented for divided attention paints a clear picture of when one's attention can and can not 
								be divided. Overall, this article introduced me to many psychological aspects of design that 
								I had not been aware of.
